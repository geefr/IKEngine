honestly can't remember what the plan was with this, or where any existing notes are

This library is intended as a tool to learn inverse kinematics, and evantually replace the junk algorithms using in the phex code (Which is so inflexible it's hard to make any progress on the project)

An appendage is defined with a string of joints and limbs e.g
body -> joint -> limb -> joint -> limb -> joint -> limb would be an arm/leg with 3 joints.

A limb in this case is any solid connection, whether a short coupling between
2 joints (servos bolted together) or long section of the appendage

A joint has a single rotational axis. If multi-axis joints are needed in the future this will need to change
